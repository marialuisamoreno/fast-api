# FastAPI Python CRUD POC

## Overview
This repository is a Proof of Concept (POC) for implementing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

## Features
- Utilizes FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities for high-performance web services.
- Demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a simple data model.
- Includes clear documentation and code comments for ease of understanding and future development.
- Offers a lightweight and efficient solution for developing RESTful APIs with Python.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the FastAPI server using `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
4. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and explore the available endpoints.
5. Use your favorite HTTP client (e.g., `Insomnia`, `Postman`, `httpie`) to interact with the API and perform CRUD operations.
